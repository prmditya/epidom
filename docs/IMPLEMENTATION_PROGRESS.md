## 💡 Key Patterns Established

### 1. Form Pattern ✅

```typescript
// Zod schema
const schema = z.object({
  /* fields */
});

// Form setup
const form = useForm<z.infer<typeof schema>>({
  resolver: zodResolver(schema),
  defaultValues: {
    /* ... */
  },
});

// Form submission
const onSubmit = async (data) => {
  setIsSubmitting(true);
  // TODO: API call
  toast({ title: "Success!" });
  form.reset();
  setOpen(false);
  setIsSubmitting(false);
};
```

### 2. Dialog Pattern ✅

```tsx
<Dialog open={open} onOpenChange={setOpen}>
  <DialogTrigger asChild>
    <Button />
  </DialogTrigger>
  <DialogContent>
    <DialogHeader>
      <DialogTitle />
      <DialogDescription />
    </DialogHeader>
    <Form {...form}>
      <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
        {/* FormFields */}
        <DialogFooter>
          <Button variant="outline">Cancel</Button>
          <Button type="submit" disabled={isSubmitting}>
            {isSubmitting && <Loader2 />}
            Submit
          </Button>
        </DialogFooter>
      </form>
    </Form>
  </DialogContent>
</Dialog>
```

### 3. Mock Data Integration ✅

```typescript
import { MOCK_SUPPLIERS } from "@/mocks";
import { MaterialCategory } from "@/types/entities";

// Use in components
{MOCK_SUPPLIERS.map((supplier) => (
  <SelectItem key={supplier.id} value={supplier.id}>
    {supplier.name}
  </SelectItem>
))}
```

### 4. API Integration (Ready) ✅

```typescript
// TODO: Replace simulation with actual API call
// const response = await fetch("/api/materials", {
//   method: "POST",
//   headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
//   body: JSON.stringify(data),
// });
```
