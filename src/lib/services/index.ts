 * Service Layer
 *
 * Services contain business logic and orchestrate repositories.
 *
 * Benefits:

 * - Makes business rules testable
 * - Enforces consistent business logic across the app
 * - Implements Dependency Inversion Principle
 *
 * Architecture:
 * API Route → Service → Repository → Database
